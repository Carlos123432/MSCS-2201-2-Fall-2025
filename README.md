# Mini Research Project: Grad-CAM for CNN Interpretability

**Author:** Carlos Mendez  
**Course:** MSCS 2201 – Artificial Intelligence  
**Topic:** Interpretability of AI Models (Grad-CAM on CNNs)

Project Overview

Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy on image classification tasks, but they often behave like black boxes. This Mini Research Project explores Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) as a post-hoc interpretability method for CNNs.

Grad-CAM produces heatmaps that highlight which regions of an image contribute most to a model’s prediction. This helps:

- Build trust in AI systems  
- Debug models when they fail  
- Inspect potential biases or spurious correlations  

This project follows the structure suggested in Lecture 9 (Interpretability / Explainability / Bias).
